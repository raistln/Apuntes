    "# **Self-Attention Computer Vision**\n",
    "\n",
    "Self-Attention Computer Vision, known technically as self_attention_cv, is a PyTorch based library providing a one-stop solution for all of the self-attention based requirements. It includes varieties of self-attention based layers and pre-trained models that can be simply employed in any custom architecture. Rather than building the self-attention layers or blocks from scratch, this library helps its users perform model building in no-time. On the other hand, the pre-trained heavy models such as TransUNet, ViT can be incorporated into custom models and can finish training in minimal time even in a CPU environment!  According to its contributors Adaloglou Nicolas and Sergios Karagiannakos, the library is still under development by updating the latest models and architectures.\n",
