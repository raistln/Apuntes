However, instead of conventional NLP approaches handling natural language questions as a semantic parsing task based on logical forms (precisely specified semantic version of the syntactic text), it is a weak-supervision technique relying on denotations (i.e. literal or primary meaning of the words and not the underlying idea or emotions). It predicts the denotation by selecting table cells, optionally applies a corresponding aggregation operator to such selection and makes end-to-end predictions."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"k15FRF3WnUSH"},"source":["To read about more, please refer
