    "ANOVA is one of the statistical tools that helps determine whether two or more data samples have significantly identical properties. Let’s assume a scenario- we have different samples collected independently from the same dataset for cross-validation. We wish to know whether the means of the collected samples are significantly the same. Another scenario- we have developed three different machine learning models. We have obtained a set of results, and we wish to know whether the models perform significantly in the same manner. Thus, there are many scenarios in practical applications where we may need to use ANOVA as part of data analytics."
